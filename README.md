This thesis focuses on the analysis and evaluation of technologies in the field of electronics, specifically MOSFET technologies. The analysis considers structural elements that define transistor technology, such as length 
L, variations in manufacturing parameters like the Corner angle, and external variables affecting performance, such as temperature T. It is essential to examine how these parameters interact within the fundamental equations governing transistor behavior, including currents, voltages, and gain, and how their variations influence overall performance.

Through a detailed understanding of the equations associated with these parameters, the distinctions between MOSFET technologies can be identified and evaluated, enabling the selection of the most suitable option for each case. However, the information provided by the equations alone may not suffice. A more comprehensive perspective requires representing these equations in common graphical formats. This visualization simplifies the observation of how changes affect performance and facilitates drawing more precise conclusions.

To address these needs, this thesis is structured to first explain and analyze the fundamental equations governing transistor operation. Subsequently, it presents detailed experimental graphs that allow for a clear and thorough comparison of the desired technologies, enabling informed decision-making.
